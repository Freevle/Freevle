Coding Guidelines
=================

We've put together some simple guidelines for Python coding.

* See PEP 8 for mostly everything.
* Use four spaces. Always. No exceptions. Ever.
* Our goals are personalization, so put everything specific to a certain app
  into the app's folder, where possible. Anything shared may go into `custom`
